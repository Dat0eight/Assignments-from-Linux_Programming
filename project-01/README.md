This is my terminal project.

Description: The shell is the term often used for the command line interpreter of an operating system (particularly for UNIX systems). That is, the shell is the program that reads and parses the userâ€™s input command line and then starts up the processes needed to carry out these command(s). My assignment is to write a simple shell for Linux using standard Linux system calls.

My project haven't perfect yet, but I did my best. Let's give me some feedback in order to learn Linux programming together.

Usage:  make -> build executable file -> ./run -> enter command.
        make clean: remove executable file

Some test cases I have entered:
-mysh% date
-mysh% gcc prog1.c
-mysh% date > file.txt
-mysh% ls -l > file.lst
-mysh% ls -l | grep -r

Note that: some features haven't finished, such as: '<' , '$', '&'

>**A Chat Application for Remote Message Exchange**
(A assignment from Linux Porgamming)

##Usage:
- Make sure you **modify MY_IP first**
- _make_: build a executable file
- _make clean_: remove a executable file
- _./run_ *<*port number*>* : run program with *<*port number*>* is the listening port. Then follow the direction inside.

##Note: 
My programming need to upgrade more function in order to chat-app run effectively. So you're my helper.
